\section{Extension to Higher Dimensions}
\label{sec:cvip_extension}

Throughout this chapter, we have been able to prove convergence to
the underlying solution because the inherent structure of the underlying
system, allowing us to compare the MSN approximation to the true solution.
While this could be extended to higher dimensions, the extensions would
be tedious and not enlightening.
General MSN theory from~\cite{msnInterp,msnBirkhoff} shows that
for any point distribution with point separation $\eta$, it is possible
to guarantee that we can choose the interpolation degree $O(\eta^{-1})$;
this shows the importance of our convergence results for degree $2Ln$.
The exact situation where this would be needed, though, is not known
and may only occur for functions in $H_{s}$
for $s\in\brackets{0,\frac{1}{2}}$.
Our examples in Chapter~\ref{chap:func_interp} show that polynomials
of degree $2n$ are usually sufficient.
Future work will investigate methods which would allow us to prove
convergence without resorting to carefully looking at the linear system
yet do not require the technical machinery used in the original
MSN proofs of~\cite{msnInterp,msnBirkhoff}.

\subsection{1D Interpolation on Chebyshev Nodes with $2n$ Degree}
\label{ssec:fa_I_1D_2n}

In this section we present a fast algorithm for 1D interpolation
on the Chebyshev nodes using polynomials up to degree $2n$.
This is based on the $LQ$ factorization from Sec.~\ref{ssec:CV_1D_2n}.

We have the following equation
%
\begin{equation}
    \min_{Va=f}\norm{D_{s}a}_{2}.
\end{equation}
%
Here, $V$ is the \CV{} matrix, $f$ is vector of function values 
with $f_{k} = f\parens{z_{k}^{n}}$, where $z_{k}^{n}$ is the $k$th
Chebyshev node as defined in Eq.~\eqref{eq:v_CV_CVnodes}.
The algorithm is quite simple:
%
\begin{align}
    y\parens{1\!:\!n} &= Y^{-1}C^{-1}f \nonumber\\
    a &= D_{s}^{-1}Gy.
\end{align}
%
An efficient memory usage, one would only need one vector
$y$ (initialized to zero) of length $2n+1$
and the rest of the operations could overwrite the vector.

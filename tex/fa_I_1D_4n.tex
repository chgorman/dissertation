\subsection{1D Interpolation on Chebyshev Nodes with $4n$ Degree}
\label{ssec:fa_I_1D_4n}

In this section we present a fast algorithm for 1D interpolation
on the Chebyshev nodes using polynomials up to degree $4n$.
This is based on the $LQ$ factorization from Sec.~\ref{ssec:CV_1D_4n}.

The setup is similar to that in Sec.~\ref{ssec:fa_I_1D_2n};
the only difference is here we have a larger \CV{} matrix.
The algorithm is quite simple:
%
\begin{align}
    y\parens{1\!:\!n} &= Y^{-1}C^{-1}f \nonumber\\
    a &= D_{s}^{-1}Gy.
\end{align}
%
An efficient memory usage, one would only need one vector
$y$ (initialized to zero) of length $4n+1$
and the rest of the operations could overwrite the vector.

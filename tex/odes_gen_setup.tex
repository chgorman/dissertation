\section{General Setup for Linear ODEs}
\label{sec:ODE_general_setup}

The general form for our linear ODE is given by
%
\begin{align}
    A(x)u'(x) + B(x)u(x) &= F(x), \quad x\in\brackets{-1,1}  \nonumber\\
    Lu &= G.
    \label{eq:ODE_gen}
\end{align}
%
Here, we are looking for a solution $u:\brackets{-1,1}\to\R^{m}$ with continuous
$A,B:[-1,1]\to\R^{m\times m}$, continuous $F:\brackets{-1,1}\to\R^{m}$,
and a linear operator $L$.
Throughout this chapter we will assume Eq.~\eqref{eq:ODE_gen}
has a unique solution.

By making some assumptions on $A$ and $B$, we are able to arrive
at fast algorithms. We will first look at the scalar case
before moving toward the general case of systems of linear ODEs.

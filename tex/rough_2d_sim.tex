\section{Results for Fast MSN Interpolation in 2D for Rough Functions}
\label{sec:rough_2D_sim}

We now look at interpolation results of rough functions in 2D.
We will attempt to interpolate the following functions:
%
\begin{align}
    J(x,y) &= H(y-\sin(\pi x)) + H(y-x^{2}) \nonumber\\
    S(x,y,\alpha) &= G(y-\sin(\pi x),\alpha) + G(y-x^{2},\alpha).
\end{align}
%
Both $J$ and $S$ are challenging functions to interpolate,
as both have difficulties along the curves $y=\sin\pi x$ and $y=x^{2}$:
$J$ is discontinuous along those curves while $S(\cdot,\cdot,\alpha)$
has infinite derivatives.

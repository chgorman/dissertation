\section{Results for Fast MSN Interpolation in 2D for Smooth Functions}
\label{sec:vs_I_2d}

We now turn our attention to the more difficult challenge
of interpolating the 2D function $f_{R}$.
For $R=25$, we have results in single and double precision presented
in Fig.~\ref{fig:smooth_comparison_2d_runge_25}.
For $R=100$, we have results in single and double precision presented
in Fig.~\ref{fig:smooth_comparison_2d_runge_100}.
From these examples, we see that, as before,
MSN interpolation has the same level of approximation as Chebyshev
interpolation for large $s$ values.

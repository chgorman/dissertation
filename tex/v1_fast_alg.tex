\section{General Algorithm for MSN Interpolation using LQ factorization}
\label{sec:interp_LQ_fast}

The algorithm for computing the MSN interpolation solution is easy
once we have the LQ factorization;
see Alg.~\ref{alg:general_lq_solution}.
We will only have fast solutions of this form when we can quickly invert
$L$ and multiply by $Q$.
Interpolation on Chebyshev nodes and expressing the result in
Chebyshev polynomials gives $L$ and $Q$ the necessary structure.
%Because we are interpolation on Chebyshev nodes,
%there is a lot of structure that we exploit.

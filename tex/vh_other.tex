\section{Extending Previous 2D \CV{} Interpolation Matrix Results}
\label{sec:CV_2D_other}

By looking at the results we have just computed, we see that to compute
fast MSN interpolation problems, we ``stack'' our linear interpolation
requirements and then use factorizations from 1D to build up the
structured LQ factorization needed.
This should work with other 2D interpolation problems in addition
to problems in higher dimensions;
the main difficulty in higher dimensions may be keeping track of
all the linear requirements (as well as the appropriate index sets)
and then inverting and applying the fast, structured matrices appropriately.
Even so, the bulk of the computational complexity comes from the 
initial IDCT.
To ensure that we can take advantage of the tensor product structure,
it is necessary to make sure we have enough columns in each matrix.
